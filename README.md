# 🚫 How NOT to Write Code: A Masterclass in Anti-Patterns

Welcome to the "What Not to Do" coding repository! This project is a living example of how to write code that will make your colleagues cry, your IDE scream, and your future self question all life choices.

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Demonstrate every anti-pattern known to mankind
- Break every SOLID principle with style
- Create spaghetti code that would make Italian chefs proud
- Show how to write code that works but makes you question your sanity
- Serve as a reference for "what not to do" in production code

## 🚨 Features (or should we say "Anti-Features"?)

- Global variables everywhere (because who needs scope?)
- Functions that do everything (single responsibility? more like single function!)
- Hard-coded values (configuration is for the weak)
- Magic numbers and strings (because who needs constants?)
- Deeply nested callbacks (callback hell is just a state of mind)
- Inconsistent naming conventions (camelCase? snake_case? Why not both?)
- Commented-out code (you never know when you might need it again)
- Dead code (it's not dead, it's just... sleeping)
- No error handling (errors are just features in disguise)
- Everything in one file (because separation of concerns is overrated)

## 🎭 How to Use This Repository

1. Clone this repository (but please don't)
2. Read the code and laugh/cry
3. Use it as a reference for what NOT to do in your own projects
4. Share with your team to demonstrate the importance of code reviews

## ⚠️ Warning

This code is intentionally bad. It's like a "what not to wear" show, but for code. While it might work, it's designed to demonstrate anti-patterns and poor practices. Please don't use this as a reference for actual production code (unless you want to be featured in a "horror stories from production" talk).

## 🎪 Contributing

Feel free to add more anti-patterns! The worse, the better. Just remember:

- If it's hard to read, it's probably good
- If it's hard to maintain, it's even better
- If it makes your IDE cry, you're on the right track
